	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>I have always been fascinated by technology. I started to learn more about software development. I was amazed by the power of code to create new things. I could see how software could be used to solve problems, improve efficiency, and make life more enjoyable. I knew that I wanted to be a part of that. I decided to upskill myself in software development because I want to use my skills to make a positive impact on the world. I want to create software that helps people, solves problems, and makes life better. I also want to be a part of the ever-evolving world of technology and help shape the future. I am motivated to become a software developer because I love to learn new things. I am always looking for new challenges and I am always eager to improve my skills. I am also motivated by the opportunity to work with talented people and to create something that will have a positive impact on the world.</p>
